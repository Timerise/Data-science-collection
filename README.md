#For the Gas station data scraping via web project (not uploaded yet):

#Gas station data scraping via web. Collecting public domain data on gas prices throughout Clarksville  and Nashville TN over time.

##Also , seeking to apply some data scraping on  mirco/marco factors that could be associated with gas pricing

##The goal is to conduct Exploratory data analysis on the various price levels via socioeconomical status of each neighborhood (mean house hold income, education levels,occupations,cost of rental properties ,paid price of homes , current value of homes,mental health attriubtes,over all health status of neighborhoods, etc..

##Will be strictly sticking to using public domain sources. Also this project is purely curiosity driven.
